# Patzer-TxTeam-Codes
This is the repository for sharing programming codes (mainly in SAS, R or Python) for statistical analysis.
You are more than welcome to add your code to the repository. 

Current covered topics include:
1. Survival analysis
<br  />1.1. Cox PH regression
<br  />1.2. Cumulative incidence curve
<br  />1.3. Competing risk moel (Fine & Gray model, SIPW Cox model, etc.)
<br  />1.4. Adjusted survival curves
2. Generalized Linear model
<br  />2.1 Check linear assumptions
<br  />2.2 Generalize linear model examples
3. Data visualisation (currently only GGplot in R)
4. Multiple imputation
<br  />4.1 Multiple imputation using proc logistic and phreg
<br  />4.2 MICE (multiple imputation chain equations)
<br  />4.3 Random forest multiple imputation ("ranger")
5. Machine learning
<br  />5.1 Light gradient boosting model (LGBM)
<br  />5.2 Categorical gradient boosting model (Catboost)
<br  />5.3 NLP LSTM model
<br  />5.4 NLP Bert model
6. Data manipulation (cuurently only cover R package "dplyr")
7. Journal style reporting in R
<br  />7.1 Table 1 reporting (Characteristics of subjects by main exposure)
<br  />7.2 Model effect size table
